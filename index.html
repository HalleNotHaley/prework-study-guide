        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <li>Opening and closing elements are usually represented with angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Elements included within the hea are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside the body element.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE is a declaration that tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE html is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive. HTML elements are case-sensitve.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and viewpoint.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL fpr a webpage.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewpoint.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines the charset, or character set. In the example webpage, it defines the charset as UTF-8, which allows us to use most characters and symbols on the page.</li>
          <li>The div element creates division in the page.</li>
          <li>The span element creates an inline division.</li>
          <li>The words "element" and "tag" are used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of a heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The img element can contain various attributes.</li>
          <li>The src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element, which stands for anchor, creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>A link element creates the connection to the exteral file</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location.</li>
          <li>To locate the style sheet from the current location, we must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css</li>
          <li>Write new declarations for a new CSS rule by designating a class attribute as the selector.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>The class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>The first declaration addresses the width of the element at #% of the available width.</li>
          <li>The margin property assigns #px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</li>
          <li>Example: The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
          <li>A box shadow is described by X an Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
          <li>Example: the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box).</li>
          <li>In the example, an HTML hexadecimal code defines the color.</li>
