        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <li>Opening and closing elements are usually represented with angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Elements included within the hea are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside the body element.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE is a declaration that tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE html is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive. HTML elements are case-sensitve.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and viewpoint.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL fpr a webpage.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewpoint.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines the charset, or character set. In the example webpage, it defines the charset as UTF-8, which allows us to use most characters and symbols on the page.</li>
          <li>The div element creates division in the page.</li>
          <li>The span element creates an inline division.</li>
          <li>The words "element" and "tag" are used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of a heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The img element can contain various attributes.</li>
          <li>The src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element, which stands for anchor, creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>

          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>A link element creates the connection to the exteral file</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location.</li>
          <li>To locate the style sheet from the current location, we must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css</li>
          <li>Write new declarations for a new CSS rule by designating a class attribute as the selector.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>The class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>The first declaration addresses the width of the element at #% of the available width.</li>
          <li>The margin property assigns #px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</li>
          <li>Example: The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
          <li>A box shadow is described by X an Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
          <li>Example: the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box).</li>
          <li>In the example, an HTML hexadecimal code defines the color.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JS is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Using JS, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li>JS is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive (ex. clicking a button, retrieve data, fill out a form)</li>
          <li>JS is a dynamic language with dynamic types (dynamic type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program at runtime).</li>
          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>In JS, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword.</li>
          <li>After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>Use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>Example: In the example involving a container named "shape" that stores a circle, we can express that in JS by var shape ="circle";</li>
          <li>By typing var topics ="HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript"; we've created a variable called topics.</li>
          <li>The topics variable contains a sstring that inclues all of the topics we are studying in this module.</li>
          <li>The string is contained wiithin quotation marks. All strings are surrounded by quotation marks. EAch line of JS code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>To access the string "HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript" refer to the variable's name, topics.</li>
          <li>On mac, to inspect website, Command+Option+I</li>
          <li>On windows, to inspect website, Control+Shift+I</li>
          <li>1. Create a new JavaScript file.</li>
          <li>2. In that file, add a variable "name" with a value of a string "list".</li>
          <li>3. Use the console.log method to log the variable to the web console in the browser.</li>
          <li>4. Ex. We connected script.js to index.html by adding a script element under the footer.</li>
          <li>5. Add a message to the header to improve the user's experience by reminding them to open the console.</li>
          <li>6. Open Chrome DevTools to find the value of topics being logged to the console, as expected.</li>
          <li>Control Flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JS, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
          <li>When using an if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>if (condition) { </li>
          <li> // block of code to be executed if condition is truthy</li>
          <li>}</li>
          <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JS file, it will check to see if the condition we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets.</li>
          <li>If the condition isn't true or has a value that isn't truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever it is between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
          <li>We can have more than one condition in JS</li>
          <li>if (first condition)</li>
          <li>  // block of code to be executed if first condition is truthy</li>
          <li>} else if (second condition) {</li>
          <li>  // block of code to be executed if second condition is truthy</li>
          <li>}</li>
          <ls>The computer will continue through all of the conditions, evaluating whether or not a condition is truthy</ls>
          <ls>Once it finds a condition that is truthy, it will run the code in the curly brackets associated with that condition, and then break out of the if statement.</ls>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>Typically, JS code is executed from top to bottom, but using conditional statements such as if statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Ex. var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
          <ls>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</ls>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiplr items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
          <li>Example: The following array stores information about a student named Lu, including his name, age, and whether he is currently enrolled: var studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true];</li>
          <li>The location of the data item in the array, identified with a unique number, is called an index.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>In order to use a for loop, we need the shape's index and the array's length.</li>
